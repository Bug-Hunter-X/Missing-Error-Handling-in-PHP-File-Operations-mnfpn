This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP file handling: the absence of error checking after closing a file. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  Improper error handling can lead to resource leaks or unexpected application behavior.  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error management in PHP applications.
